awesome job so far! please think deeper and think harder to meticulously explore thoroughly and systematically how best to create a detailed, comprehensive, informative and attractive `README.md` for the GitHub repo https://github.com/nordeim/customer-support-agent.git that host this project. include a section to describe the application architecture with a file hierarchy diagram listing key files with their description, a mermaid diagram to describe the user and application interaction, and a mermaid diagram to show the application logic flow, a section on deployment. try to make it an awesome, complete and useful `README.md` for the project. then meticulously create a plan to create the `README.md`. review and validate the plan before proceeding cautiously to execute.

2) Microsoft Agent Framework implemented as python FASTAPI backend, use the programming guide in the URL link given below.

3)  use sqlite to implement memory system for operating needs

4)  RAG with embedding model https://huggingface.co/google/embeddinggemma-300m and chroma as vector database.  

5) Use python package for attachment processing. Refer to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/markitdown/refs/heads/main/README.md

awesome job so far! Please think deeper and think harder to meticulously explore thoroughly and systematically how best to create a detailed, comprehensive, informative and attractive `README.md` for the GitHub repo https://github.com/nordeim/customer-support-agent.git that hosts this project. include a section to describe the application architecture with a file hierarchy diagram listing key files with their description, a mermaid diagram to describe the user and application interaction, and a mermaid diagram to show the application logic flow, and a section on deployment. Try to make it an awesome, complete, and useful `README.md` for the project. Then meticulously create a plan to create the `README.md`. Review and validate the plan before proceeding cautiously to execute.

# Phase 1 — Request Analysis and Plan

## Scope-Priority Track Declaration

**Chosen Track: Production-Ready**

I've selected the Production-Ready track for this customer support AI agent project. This choice aligns with the requirements for a robust, observable, and maintainable system that includes CI gating, integration tests, SLOs, deployment automation, and rollback plans. The system will have multiple components (React frontend, Python backend, vector database) and handle sensitive customer data, which necessitates the production-ready approach.

## Assumptions & Acceptance of Constraints

### Assumptions
1. The system will be deployed in a containerized environment (Docker + docker-compose)
2. The React frontend will communicate with the backend via REST API initially, with potential WebSocket support for streaming responses
3. The Microsoft Agent Framework (Python) will be used as specified in the provided programming guide
4. SQLite will be used for the memory system with the understanding that scaling may require migration to a more robust database
5. Chroma will be used as the vector database for RAG implementation
6. The embedding model from HuggingFace (embeddinggemma-300m) will be used for document embeddings
7. The markitdown package will be used for attachment processing
8. The system will handle typical customer support flows including escalation to human agents
9. Authentication will be session-based with anonymous or known user support
10. The knowledge base will be pre-loaded with documents and can be extended with user attachments

### Explicit Acceptance of Access & Tooling Constraints
I accept the following constraints:
- I will only read and modify repository files provided in the workspace
- I will not access resources outside the workspace unless explicitly permitted
- I will run tests and linters via configured CI commands only when the CI environment is defined
- I will not access secrets, external databases, or third-party paid services unless a secure credential mechanism is supplied
- I will produce CI configs and Docker artifacts but will not trigger external deployments
- I will suggest integrations and produce configuration files but will not enable them in remote services
- Any external execution steps will be declared as external steps with generated artifacts for human execution

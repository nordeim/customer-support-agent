# Design Decisions Document

## Overview
This document outlines the key design decisions made during the development of the Customer Support AI Agent system.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Microservices Architecture
**Decision**: Adopted microservices architecture with separate frontend, backend, database, and monitoring services.

**Rationale**:
- Allows independent scaling of components
- Improves fault isolation
- Enables technology diversity
- Simplifies deployment and maintenance

**Trade-offs**:
- Increased operational complexity
- Network latency between services
- More complex debugging

### 2. Technology Stack

#### Frontend: React with TypeScript
**Decision**: Used React with TypeScript for the frontend.

**Rationale**:
- Strong typing improves code quality
- Large ecosystem and community support
- Component-based architecture
- Good developer experience

**Trade-offs**:
- Steeper learning curve for TypeScript
- More verbose code compared to JavaScript

#### Backend: FastAPI with Python
**Decision**: Used FastAPI with Python for the backend.

**Rationale**:
- High performance with async support
- Automatic API documentation
- Type hints improve code quality
- Rich ecosystem for AI/ML libraries

**Trade-offs**:
- Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limitations
- Performance compared to compiled languages

#### Database: PostgreSQL
**Decision**: Used PostgreSQL as the primary database.

**Rationale**:
- ACID compliance
- Rich feature set (JSON support, indexing)
- Strong consistency
- Good tooling and monitoring

**Trade-offs**:
- More complex than SQLite
- Requires more resources

#### Vector Database: Chroma
**Decision**: Used Chroma for vector storage and retrieval.

**Rationale**:
- Lightweight and easy to deploy
- Good integration with Python
- Supports metadata filtering
- Active development

**Trade-offs**:
- Less mature than enterprise solutions
- Limited scalability for very large datasets

### 3. AI Framework Integration

#### Microsoft Agent Framework
**Decision**: Integrated Microsoft Agent Framework for AI capabilities.

**Rationale**:
- Provides structured approach to AI agent development
- Built-in tool calling and context management
- Good documentation and examples
- Enterprise-ready features

**Trade-offs**:
- Vendor lock-in concerns
- Limited customization options
- Dependency on external service

#### RAG Implementation
**Decision**: Implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation for knowledge base integration.

**Rationale**:
- Improves response accuracy
- Reduces hallucinations
- Provides source citations
- Easy to update knowledge

**Trade-offs**:
- Increased response latency
- Complexity in embedding management
- Requires good quality documents

### 4. Caching Strategy

#### Redis Integration
**Decision**: Implemented Redis for caching RAG queries and session data.

**Rationale**:
- Improves response times
- Reduces database load
- Supports various data structures
- Good performance

**Trade-offs**:
- Additional infrastructure component
- Memory usage considerations
- Cache invalidation complexity

### 5. Monitoring and Observability

#### Prometheus + Grafana Stack
**Decision**: Used Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for monitoring
- Rich visualization capabilities
- Good alerting features
- Active community

**Trade-offs**:
- Steeper learning curve
- More infrastructure to maintain
- Configuration complexity

## Security Considerations

### 1. Authentication and Authorization
**Decision**: Implemented JWT-based authentication with role-based access control.

**Rationale**:
- Stateless authentication
- Widely adopted standard
- Good library support
- Scalable solution

### 2. Input Validation
**Decision**: Implemented comprehensive input validation and sanitization.

**Rationale**:
- Prevents injection attacks
- Ensures data integrity
- Improves error handling
- Compliance requirements

### 3. Rate Limiting
**Decision**: Implemented rate limiting to prevent abuse.

**Rationale**:
- Prevents DoS attacks
- Ensures fair usage
- Controls costs
- Improves stability

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Connection Pooling
**Decision**: Implemented database connection pooling.

**Rationale**:
- Reduces connection overhead
- Improves throughput
- Better resource utilization
- Configurable limits

### 2. Async Processing
**Decision**: Used async/await for I/O operations.

**Rationale**:
- Improves concurrency
- Better resource utilization
- Reduced response times
- Scales better

### 3. Caching Layers
**Decision**: Implemented multiple caching layers.

**Rationale**:
- Reduces redundant computations
- Improves response times
- Decreases database load
- Better user experience

## Future Considerations

### 1. Scalability
- Consider container orchestration (Kubernetes)
- Implement horizontal auto-scaling
- Optimize database queries
- Consider read replicas

### 2. High Availability
- Implement multi-region deployment
- Add database failover
- Implement circuit breakers
- Add health checks

### 3. Security Enhancements
- Implement zero-trust architecture
- Add security scanning
- Implement audit logging
- Consider WAF integration

### 4. AI Improvements
- Fine-tune embedding models
- Implement context compression
- Add conversation analytics
- Consider multi-modal support

## Conclusion
The design decisions made prioritize reliability, maintainability, and scalability while balancing complexity and performance. The architecture allows for future growth and adaptation to changing requirements.
